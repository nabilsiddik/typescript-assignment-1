# What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

In Typescript we can use both interfaces and types to define the shape of data. They often server similar purposes, but definitely they have important differences. And we have to know that when to use which one and which one can improve the flexibility of our code depending on the situation. 

### Syntax and Intent

**Interface**: Interface is typically used to describe the shape of objects and it is favourite for classes and large structures. 
Code example:
interface Student{
	name: string;
	id: number
	address: string
}

**Type alias**: Type alias can represent not only the shape of object but also unions, primitives, tuples and other types.
Code example:
type User = {
	name: string;
	age: number;
}

type ID = string | number


### Extending and Merging
**Interface**: Interface can be extended using the “extends” keyword and they can merge declarations automatically.

Code example:
interface Animal{
	name: string;
}
interface Animal{
	age: number;
}

It will merge as  {name: string; age: number}


**Type**: Types cannot merge, but they can extend using intersections.
Code example:
interface Animal{
	name: string;
}

Type NewAnimal = Animal & {age: number}


### Compatibility with classes
We can use types with classes but interfaces are the standard tool for that use case. A class can implement an interface.

Code example:
interface Shape{
	area(): number;
}


Class Circle implements Shape{
	area(){
	    return Math.PI * 1 * 1
    }
}













# How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

These days, keeping code clean, predictable and scalable is a challenge. This is where typescript is a blessing. Typescript adds powerful features to JavaScript where developer can catch errors early, write cleaner code, and scale projects.
In this blog I will explain how TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability.


### Catching errors at compile time

One of the greatest strength of TypeScript is it’s compile time error checking. In plain JavaScript, many bugs show up at run time. But TypeScript can catch these error at compile time. It can catch common issues like:

- Accessing properties that don’t exist
- Passing the wrong argument types
- Returning unexpected values from functions etc

This immediate compile time error catching help developers saving their time and reduces bugs.


### Better code autocompletion and IDE support

One of the most noticeable benefits of TypeScript is development experience in our code editor specially in the Visual Studio Code. TypeScripts intellisense give us real time suggestions while we write code. It gives us suggestions like:

- Property and method names
- Function arguments
- Expected return types etc

It only suggest valid methods, prevent invalid property access and update suggestions when type change. This things speeds up development and reduces mistakes.


### Clear contracts with interface and types

In JavaScript object can be passed freely as normal structure. It often leads to bugs and misunderstanding. Typescript solve this by introducing interface nad type alias. This interfaces and types tell us the shape of data we should have. In compile time it enforce us to make data shape specific.


### Refactoring with confidence

In fast growing and learge applications refactoring like renaming variables, restructuring functions, redesigning data models or any changes become necessary but at a time it can be risky. Because one small mistake in Javascript can break our whole application.
Typescript acts as a powerful safety net here. When we change anything in typescript, the compiler keeps an eye on every change. Typescript immediately alert us wherever that change goes wrong.
Without typescript this kind of change could lead to bugs that only show at run time. With typescript we can know instantly which file need updating. So, this this way typescript helps developers refactoring.

Typescript is more that just a tool. It makes Javascript more powerful with type safety. If we want to improve our code quality and maintain our project in a better way, Typescript is must.
